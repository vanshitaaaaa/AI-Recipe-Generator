      "INSTRUCTIONS:\n",

      "Step 1: Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a rolling boil for the pasta.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Step 3: In a large skillet or wide pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for 1-2 minutes until fragrant and lightly golden, being careful not to burn it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 4: Add the diced tomatoes to the skillet. Season with a pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cook for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes have softened and released their juices, forming a rustic sauce. You can lightly crush them with the back of a spoon if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 5: Once the pasta water is boiling, add the pasta and cook according to package directions until al dente. Before draining, reserve about 1 cup of the starchy pasta cooking water.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 6: Drain the pasta and add it directly to the skillet with the tomato sauce. Add most of the torn fresh basil leaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 7: Toss the pasta with the sauce, adding a splash of the reserved pasta water if needed to create a smoother, more cohesive sauce that coats the pasta beautifully. Continue to toss for 1-2 minutes over low heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 8: Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper as necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 9: Serve immediately, garnished with the remaining fresh basil leaves.\n",

      "COOKING TIPS:\n",
      "------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "  • Always use good quality, ripe tomatoes for the best flavor, especially since they are the star of this simple dish.\n",
      "  • Don't overcook the garlic; it should be fragrant, not browned or bitter, as this can make the sauce taste harsh.\n",
      "  • Adding a splash of the starchy pasta water helps the sauce cling to the pasta and emulsifies the sauce, giving it a richer texture.\n",
      "  • Add fresh basil at the very end of cooking to preserve its vibrant flavor and color.\n",

Remove from heat and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes before fluffing with a fork.\n",

      "\n",
      "Step 6: Pour in the full-fat coconut milk. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer, then reduce heat to low, cover, and let it cook for 15-20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and tender. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 7: Taste the curry and adjust seasoning with more salt or curry powder if needed. If the sauce is too thick, you can add a splash of water or chicken broth (if available).\n",

      "COOKING TIPS:\n",
      "------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "  • For a spicier kick, add a pinch of cayenne pepper or a chopped green chili along with the curry powder.\n",
      "  • Chicken thighs are recommended for their tenderness and flavor, but boneless, skinless chicken breast can be used; just be careful not to overcook it.\n",
      "  • Garnish with fresh cilantro if you have it available for a burst of freshness and color.\n",
      "  • The curry can be made ahead of time and reheated; flavors often deepen overnight.\n",

      "\n",
      "INSTRUCTIONS:\n",
      "------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 1: **Prepare the Dough:** In a large bowl, combine maida and salt. Add 2 tablespoons of oil and rub it into the flour until it resembles breadcrumbs. Gradually add water and knead into a firm yet pliable dough. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for 20-30 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 2: **Prepare the Filling:** Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter. Add finely chopped onion (and green chili, ginger-garlic paste if using) and sauté until golden brown.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 3: Add finely chopped tomato, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Cook until the tomatoes soften and the oil separates from the mixture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 4: Add the mashed potatoes and garam masala. Mix well and cook for 2-3 minutes. Stir in the coarsely crushed roasted peanuts. Cook for another minute, then remove from heat and let the filling cool completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 5: **Assemble the Kachoris:** Divide the dough into 8-10 equal portions. Roll each portion into a small disc (about 3-4 inches in diameter) using a rolling pin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 6: Place 1-2 tablespoons of the cooled filling in the center of each disc. Bring the edges of the dough together and seal tightly to form a ball. Flatten gently to create a disc-like shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 7: **Fry the Kachoris:** Heat enough oil for deep frying in a heavy-bottomed pan or kadai over medium-low heat. Once the oil is moderately hot (not smoking), gently slide in 3-4 kachoris at a time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 8: Fry the kachoris on low to medium heat, turning occasionally, until they puff up and turn golden brown and crispy on all sides. This slow frying process helps to cook the kachori thoroughly and makes the crust flaky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 9: Remove the fried kachoris with a slotted spoon and place them on absorbent paper to drain excess oil.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 10: Serve hot with green chutney, tamarind chutney, or tomato ketchup.\n",
      "\n",
      "COOKING TIPS:\n",
      "------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "  • For a flaky crust, ensure the oil is rubbed well into the maida for the dough, and the dough is firm.\n",
      "  • Fry kachoris on low to medium heat. If the oil is too hot, they will brown quickly on the outside but remain raw inside, and won't puff up properly.\n",
      "  • Ensure the filling is completely cool before stuffing into the dough to prevent the dough from tearing during frying.\n",
      "  • Seal the kachoris properly to prevent the filling from coming out into the oil during frying.\n",
